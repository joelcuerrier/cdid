\usage{
\method{summary}{MP}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{MP} object, representing the results of a multi-period analysis.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the function.}
}
\value{
No return value. This function is called for its side effects of
printing a summary of the \code{MP} object to the console, including:
\itemize{
\item Call: The call used to create the \code{MP} object.
\item Group-Time Average Treatment Effects: A table of estimates with confidence bands.
\item Control Group: Information about the chosen control group (e.g., "Never Treated").
\item Anticipation Periods: Number of periods used to account for anticipation effects.
\item Estimation Method: Method used for treatment effect estimation.
\item Pre-Test Results: p-values for the test of parallel trends assumption, if available.
}
}
\description{
Prints a detailed summary of an \code{MP} object. The function outputs key details of
the group-time average treatment effects, such as estimation method, control group,
and pre-test results for parallel trends.
